There Are Also Uncensored Pictures Of The Event Of G30S/PKI, Terrifying. Overall, It's A Good Museum, Kind Of Hard To Access Because The Nearest Public Transport Shelter Is About 10 Minutes Walk.\", 'The Sasmita Loka Ahmad Yani Museum, located in Central Jakarta, Indonesia, was originally the residence of a Dutch or European director of a private company, later used as housing for military officers in the 1950s. It gained historical significance as the place where General Ahmad Yani, a national hero, was shot by members of the 30 September Movement in 1965. After his death, Mrs. Yani transformed the house into a public museum in October 1965, preserving its original interior, including bullet holes in the door and walls. The museum exhibits collections related to Ahmad Yani and features dioramas depicting the events of the G-30-S/PKI. Open to the public from Tuesday to Sunday, 08:00 to 14:00 local time, the museum offers free admission.', 'This museum told us about the life of Jend. A. Yani lives before his passing because of G30SPKI, we can even see the place he was shot down and several bullet marks.\\n\\nNot only told us about the night of his passing, we also can see all the item has, based on the information from Kapten Suroso, almost 90% of the collection on the museum are still authentic.', \"G30s PKI was an unforgettable yet unprecedented rebellion that this nation had witnessed and undergone almost seventy years ago in the early days of establishment. And this mouseum which more likely seemed to be a house, was an eye witnessed of the peak of the rebellion. Sasmitaloka museum was a former house of late general and minister Ahmad Yani. He was assassinated in his house by the group of Communism Party who pretended to be his escorts. This museum will explain you guys more about the scenes and details about what had happened during by the time. Luckily, this museum is free and you will be accompanied by a guide. The house had kept to be as much as authentic as possible due to value of history. Yet unfortunately mostly on daily basis this museum is so quiet and rarely visited. And as a hint if clues, indeed for those who infatuated in antic stuff etc- there you'll see many gifts that the General Ahmad Yani had received during his reign such as a taxidermied tiger, head of onimusha (japanese warlord headpiece), armories, a phenomenal impala car, and a numerous details that they would more lovely to be witnessed by you guys in first hand.\", 'The museum actually General Achmad Yani house with his family until he was shot by Cakrabirawa soldier at 30th September/PKI movement.\\n\\nThe house showed General activity from Colonel until Lieutenant General from the photo collection that rarely showed from student history book. The museum also showed another revolutionary heroes photos & their own collection (bags, glasses, shoes etc) who also killed by soldier.']\n",

You'll find creatures from both Indonesia and around the world, making it a great place to learn about different habitats and species.\\n\\nSpacious Enclosures: The enclosures are generally spacious and well-maintained, offering animals enough room to move and express natural behaviors. This is especially commendable compared to some older zoos, and it's encouraging to see the focus on animal welfare.\\n\\nInteractive Activities: Beyond just observing animals, Gembira Loka offers interactive experiences like elephant and camel rides, bird feeding, and even touching sessions with certain animals. These activities can be particularly exciting for children and add a unique dimension to the visit.\\n\\nAdditional Attractions: The zoo goes beyond just animals, with various playgrounds, gardens, and even a water park (Gemoira Waterpark) providing additional entertainment for families. This makes it a perfect destination for a full day out.\\n\\nAffordable Entry and Convenient Location: Gembira Loka offers reasonable ticket prices, making it accessible for most families. Additionally, its location within Yogyakarta city limits makes it easily reachable by public transportation or taxi.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n\\nPotentially Crowded: Depending on the day and time, Gembira Loka can get quite crowded, especially during peak season and weekends. This can make navigating the grounds and viewing some exhibits challenging.\\n\\nUneven Terrain: Some areas of the zoo, particularly those closer to the water park, have sloping or uneven terrain. This might be difficult for visitors with mobility issues or young children.\\n\\nLimited Food Options: While there are several food stalls within the zoo, the options tend toward simple snacks and fast food. Visitors looking for a more sit-down dining experience might be better off bringing their own picnic lunch.\\n\\nOverall Impression:\\n\\nDespite minor drawbacks, Gembira Loka Zoo leaves a positive impression. Its diverse animal collection, interactive activities, and affordable price make it a great choice for a family outing or a casual visit for animal lovers. Just be prepared for potential crowds and limited food options. My recommendation is to arrive early on weekdays to avoid the biggest crowds and enjoy a peaceful experience among the fascinating creatures of Gembira Loka.\\n\\nAdditional Tips:\\n\\nWear comfortable shoes, as you'll be doing a fair amount of walking.\\n\\nBring sunscreen and a hat, especially if visiting during the midday sun.\\n\\nConsider renting a stroller for young children to navigate the large zoo grounds.\\n\\nTake advantage of the information boards and feeding schedules to learn more about the animals.\\n\\nMost importantly, respect the animals and their enclosures.\\n\\nI hope this review helps you decide whether Gembira Loka Zoo is the right destination for your next outing!\"]\n",

Coincidentally, he is also going to the mosque to pray nearby the batik art gallery and can show the way.

During that time some red flags have also popped up, for pricing they have a list based on size. During that time, there was also another Indonesian family and as I understood Indonesian I am trying to overhear how much are they offered, this was of course much lower than prices we have. While it looked like I was overhearing that conversation, the man attending us noticed and tried to strike conversations with me. however after 30 mins of discussion we still have doubts because we do not have any space to display it. Telling the man we are leaving and need time to think, now he became aggressive and start lowering the price. If all proceeds go to the orphanage you would wonder why he would be so aggressive. And I also now asked why the indo family is offered less for way bigger batik, his reply is now batik price is not by size but artist. Now the price has dropped from 1.5m rupiah to 1.1 rupiah. However as the main concern is where to put it, we continued to walk out, of course this man chased us outside and now offered 750k rupiah without caring that our issue is not with price but where to put it. Rejecting this, he is now pissed and said we have wasted 2 hours of his time (hyperbole) and if we walk away now don‚Äôt come back and the 750k price is gone and they have enough tourists. He is also starting to get more rude and heated up by saying this is bad behaviour, etc. luckily we walked away still and does not have to be constantly reminded by the aggression if we would have purchased.

You'll find creatures from both Indonesia and around the world, making it a great place to learn about different habitats and species.\\n\\nSpacious Enclosures: The enclosures are generally spacious and well-maintained, offering animals enough room to move and express natural behaviors. This is especially commendable compared to some older zoos, and it's encouraging to see the focus on animal welfare.\\n\\nInteractive Activities: Beyond just observing animals, Gembira Loka offers interactive experiences like elephant and camel rides, bird feeding, and even touching sessions with certain animals. These activities can be particularly exciting for children and add a unique dimension to the visit.\\n\\nAdditional Attractions: The zoo goes beyond just animals, with various playgrounds, gardens, and even a water park (Gemoira Waterpark) providing additional entertainment for families. This makes it a perfect destination for a full day out.\\n\\nAffordable Entry and Convenient Location: Gembira Loka offers reasonable ticket prices, making it accessible for most families. Additionally, its location within Yogyakarta city limits makes it easily reachable by public transportation or taxi.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n\\nPotentially Crowded: Depending on the day and time, Gembira Loka can get quite crowded, especially during peak season and weekends. This can make navigating the grounds and viewing some exhibits challenging.\\n\\nUneven Terrain: Some areas of the zoo, particularly those closer to the water park, have sloping or uneven terrain. This might be difficult for visitors with mobility issues or young children.\\n\\nLimited Food Options: While there are several food stalls within the zoo, the options tend toward simple snacks and fast food. Visitors looking for a more sit-down dining experience might be better off bringing their own picnic lunch.\\n\\nOverall Impression:\\n\\nDespite minor drawbacks, Gembira Loka Zoo leaves a positive impression. Its diverse animal collection, interactive activities, and affordable price make it a great choice for a family outing or a casual visit for animal lovers. Just be prepared for potential crowds and limited food options. My recommendation is to arrive early on weekdays to avoid the biggest crowds and enjoy a peaceful experience among the fascinating creatures of Gembira Loka.\\n\\nAdditional Tips:\\n\\nWear comfortable shoes, as you'll be doing a fair amount of walking.\\n\\nBring sunscreen and a hat, especially if visiting during the midday sun.\\n\\nConsider renting a stroller for young children to navigate the large zoo grounds.\\n\\nTake advantage of the information boards and feeding schedules to learn more about the animals.\\n\\nMost importantly, respect the animals and their enclosures.\\n\\nI hope this review helps you decide whether Gembira Loka Zoo is the right destination for your next outing!\"],\n",

Coincidentally, he is also going to the mosque to pray nearby the batik art gallery and can show the way. As we arrived at the ‚Äòbatik gallery‚Äô in a small shop in an alley near Malioboro, a new man from the shop took over and gave batik intro to us like real batik must have 2 same sides and in art gallery, all proceeds go to the orphanage. We were initially not aware of the scam and was genuinely interested in buying 1 (currently A3 sized is 1.5 million rupiah). During that time some red flags have also popped up, for pricing they have a list based on size. During that time, there was also another Indonesian family and as I understood Indonesian I am trying to overhear how much are they offered, this was of course much lower than prices we have. While it looked like I was overhearing that conversation, the man attending us noticed and tried to strike conversations with me. however after 30 mins of discussion we still have doubts because we do not have any space to display it. Telling the man we are leaving and need time to think, now he became aggressive and start lowering the price. If all proceeds go to the orphanage you would wonder why he would be so aggressive. And I also now asked why the indo family is offered less for way bigger batik, his reply is now batik price is not by size but artist. Now the price has dropped from 1.5m rupiah to 1.1 rupiah. However as the main concern is where to put it, we continued to walk out, of course this man chased us outside and now offered 750k rupiah without caring that our issue is not with price but where to put it. Rejecting this, he is now pissed and said we have wasted 2 hours of his time (hyperbole) and if we walk away now don‚Äôt come back and the 750k price is gone and they have enough tourists. He is also starting to get more rude and heated up by saying this is bad behaviour, etc. luckily we walked away still and does not have to be constantly reminded by the aggression if we would have purchased.
